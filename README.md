### Getting Started with Development

This project is dependent upon the parent solution, YAFNET.  This requires that the steps you follow be specific.

1. Create a local directory for your project o live, such as C:\dev\YAFDev\ (just an example path).
2. Fork this YAFNET-DNN project into your account and then clone it into the local folder you just created. There should now be a C:\dev\YAFDev\yaf_dnn\ folder, as well as a README and other Git files.
3. (Optional) Attach an upstream to this YAFNET-DNN project in Git.
4. Download a copy of the netfx branch of [the YAFNET project](https://github.com/YAFNET/YAFNET), and extract to the main folder. The resulting path should be C:\dev\YAFDev\yafsrc\.
5. Open and then build the YAFNET solution.
6. Open and then build the YAFNET-DNN solution.

Congratulations! You're now ready to begin development.
